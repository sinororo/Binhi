3. Click the picture of the leaf.
4. Now that you can see the disease of your plant, click learn more at the bottom center.
5. You will now be on a website to know more about the disease of your plant

If you want to view the notebook click plant-disease-classifier-fastai.ipynb which is below this readme.

If you want to run the notebook,
1. Make sure that you have a Kaggle account
2. Click the link https://www.kaggle.com/code/sinoro12/plant-disease-classifier-fastai/notebook
3. Click the "Copy and Edit" button which can be seen in the upper right.

Note that Kaggle is the platform used since in using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook, you need to have a GPU for running deep learning models. Kaggle has an available GPU already within its notebook. To access this, just follow this link. https://medium.com/aiplusoau/how-to-use-kaggle-and-google-colab-notebooks-with-gpu-enabled-c2a1512cd4f Meanwhile you need to setup Google Cloud if you opt to use Google Colab or Jupyter. To have a Google cloud account, the user must have a credit card information.
